# passwordgenerator

A password generator I made for class

The website is a box with a button to generate a password.

Once the user presses the button it uses a prompt and several confirms to get user input data on password conditions(ie. length, upper/lower case, numbers, special characters)

It then randomly generators a password that contains the desired character types.

The program then takes the generated password and inserts a random one of each required character type into a randomly generated location in the password string.
This is so that it ensures that at LEAST one of each type WILL be generated. 

It then returns the editted password and displays it on the screen.
